# Rooms â€“ Social Streaming Platform
A MERN stack social media application that allows users to stream live video from their rooms and watch streams from people around the world. This project demonstrates full-stack development, real-time video streaming, authentication, and responsive UI design.

## Overview
Rooms is a social media platform where users can create personal streaming rooms, broadcast live video, and watch streams from other users globally. Viewers can interact through chat, follow favorite streamers, and explore streams via an interactive world map. This project highlights real-time streaming, user authentication, and full-stack integration using modern JavaScript technologies.

## Features
User registration and login with JWT authentication
Create and manage personal streaming rooms
Watch live streams from other users worldwide
Real-time chat in each streaming room
Follow and discover streamers
Explore streams using an interactive world map
Responsive UI built with React and CSS
Backend with Node.js + Express + MongoDB
Basic unit tests for key backend routes and React components


## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, JavaScript, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT
Real-time Communication: Socket.io
Interactive Map: Google Maps

## Installation & Usage
### Clone the repository:
git clone git@github.com:benjamingarciap/rooms.git
### Install dependencies:
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
### Create a .env file in the server folder with:
MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret>
### Start backend server:
npm run server
### Start frontend:
npm start
### Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser

## Architecture & Decisions
Chose MERN stack for full-stack demonstration
Used JWT authentication for secure user login
Used Socket.io for real-time chat and global stream updates
Interactive world map allows users to discover streams geographically
MongoDB for flexible schema to manage users, rooms, and streams
React component structure designed for scalability and responsive UI

## Challenges & Learnings
Built a social streaming platform with multi-user, real-time features
Managed CORS, authentication, and WebRTC peer connections
Integrated interactive map for global stream discovery
Handled state management for multiple simultaneous streams
Learned to integrate frontend and backend for a real-time full-stack application

## Next Steps / Improvements
Add recording and replay of streams
Implement stream recommendations and search
Integrate Redux or Zustand for advanced state management
Improve UI/UX and mobile responsiveness

Expand unit and integration tests
